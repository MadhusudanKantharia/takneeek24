PROBLEM GOLD COINS 101:-
i declared 5 variables namely A,B,X,Y,chef,took the inputs of corrosponding values and then used basic if else to determine if chef or chifina won and assgined chef the no. of gold coins accordingly(A or B) and then printed the no. of coins chef has.

PROBLEM INDEPENDENCE DAY 101:-
I declared 4 variables namely a,b,c,n where a,b,c represent the no. of flags of a certain colour and n is the no. of test cases ran,I thinked firstly for two colours that what should be the possible cases in whivh no strips of same colours are together,which i cam to the conclusion that at most they can have a difference of 1 ,usig the same analogy i cam to the coclusion that if there exist a colour which has larger no. of strips then it cannot be greater than (sum of the other two colour strips)+1
therefore
a>b+c+1
b>a+c+1
c>b+a+1
directly imply not possible
hence then i used basic if-else and scanf to solve the overall problem.
